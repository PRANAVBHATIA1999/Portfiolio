<p class="aboutme"> I'm really passionate about  computers. I was lucky enough to find what I love to do early in life, I developed interest in the field of computers when I was 10, looking at my father working in an IT field. <br> 
I want to learn a lot of things in this field, I believe learning is a life skill; when I reflect on why I believe that, it’s easy to make the connection from my own life experiences- My father is an engineer and my mother is dentist, both of them has played a really important role in my life. </p>
